When India parked at a 7-Eleven, the officers also parked and approached the car. Officers claim Angelo shot at them first. They shot over thirty times at the vehicle, where Angelo, India and her 4 month-old baby were inside. Angelo and India were killed, while the baby was unharmed. Kager's mother disputes the police narrative. “It was very clear to me that India was not part of the police investigation based on the responses I got from police. She had nothing to do with it. She was totally innocent,” she told the Washington Post. “Did they find any weapons on India? Did she pose a threat? Why did [police] shoot into a car with a baby and woman who had nothing to do with their investigation? I’m devastated because she should still be alive nursing her son, my grandson,” she explained. “We’re talking about a very beautiful soul that should still be here. She was unarmed, she was completely innocent. They shot indiscriminately.”",Unarmed
